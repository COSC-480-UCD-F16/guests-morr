# Questions for Guest Speakers

We will have several guest speakers visit our class this semester. Each visit will include a discussion focused on the speaker's research and career. To guide the discussion, each student will submit at least one candidate "interview question" as an issue on this GitHub repo by the evening before the visit. Students will be able to respond to their classmate's suggested questions with comments and "reactions". The questions with the most positive reactions will be the priority for in-class discussion with the guest speaker.
