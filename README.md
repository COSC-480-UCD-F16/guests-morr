# Questions for Guests

We will have several guest speakers visit our class this semester, in person or via video call. A file will be created in this repo including the details of each visit and a brief bio of the guest. Students will be expected to read this file and complete any related assignments before the guest's visit. Types of assignments will include:

## Interview Questions
Each visit will include a discussion focused on the guest's research and career. To guide the discussion, each student will submit at least one candidate "interview question" as an issue on this GitHub repo by the evening before the visit. Students will be able to respond to their classmate's suggested questions with comments and "reactions". The questions with the most positive reactions will be the priority for in-class discussion with the guest speaker. 

## Reading
Guests may request that you read a particular chapter or article before their visit. Any assigned readings will be posted on the class schedule along with a description in the speaker's file in this repo.
