# Guest #2: [Yu Chen, PhD](http://www.yuchenhci.info/)
Dr. Chen is currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Gloria Mark at Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. As a researcher, designer, and engineer, her research is mainly grounded in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Work, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. She aims to apply social psychology theories in mobile technologies to enhance human welfare. She first gathers user requirements using qualitative methods, and then implements system interfaces and functions with standard design and development tools. She evaluates those systems by conducting longitudinal studies using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. 

Yu received her Ph.D. in Computer and Communication Sciences from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland in 2015. Her supervisor was Dr. Pearl Pu, the director of Human Computer Interaction Group. Before that, she received Master's degrees in Security and Mobile Computing from both Aalto University in Finland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Norway in 2010 and Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China in 2008. She was also a research intern in the headquarter of Nokia Research Center in Helsinki in 2009 and 2010.
